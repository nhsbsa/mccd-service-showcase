        ## Approach
    </GridColumn>
    
    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        As the MCCD is within the DHSC Death Certification Reform Programme, our approach has been to work with the other stakeholders in the death management journey throughout our alpha, to ensure we’re taking a holistic approach to the service journey.

        We ran a session with the DHSC Policy team to review Programme outcomes against user needs and the service journey map, to agree a set of user-centred outcomes for the MCCD.

        We then ran two workshops to map user needs against outcomes, prioritise these, and identify success and failure indicators against the key outcomes identified for the MCCD, which included representation from:

        * DHSC Death Certification Reform Policy
        * ONS
        * GRO
        * HMPO
        * Welsh Government

        ## Challenges
    </GridColumn>
    
    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        As identified in our key learnings, the wider death management journey the MCCD sits within is a highly variable environment, with factors that may impact our outcomes and ability to measure performance against them:

        * Death management journey – there are other systems and actors within this wider journey also working to the same policy outcomes
        * Variation in local practices – the order and type of activities involved in a successful user journey can vary significantly between locations
        * Service transformation – being part of a wider transformation programme, users of the MCCD service will be adjusting to other changes to their processes and ways of working
        * Holistic reporting – many outcomes are driven by the impact on the overall journey, reporting against these requires access to data from our stakeholders

        As a result, we have focused our efforts on where the MCCD can make a measurable impact, or where we can contribute to an outcome alongside the other stakeholders in the journey, and identified three priority outcomes.

    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        ### At anytime and anywhere, the right attending practitioners (or when appropriate, the medical examiner) can easily record the proposed cause of death

        <Table>
            <TableHeader>
                <TableCell>Success indicators</TableCell>
                <TableCell>Failure indicators</TableCell>
            </TableHeader>
            <TableRow>
                <TableCell>
                    * Bilingual MCCDs – measure those completed in both Welsh and English, of all MCCDs completed in Wales
                    * System availability - track the service uptime and aim for at least 99% availability, with a maximum allowable downtime of 1% per month.
                    * Page load time - measure the average page load time
                    * Cost per transaction – measuring the cost-efficiency of the service to identify opportunities to become more cost-efficient.
                </TableCell>
                <TableCell>
                    * Offline uptake – the proportion of MCCDs that are completed via the offline route instead of the digital
                    * MCCDs not finished – the number of MCCDs that are started but not submitted to a Medical Examiner, although there are reasons this may be required, e.g. coroner referrals – these users will be targeted for follow-up feedback
                </TableCell>
            </TableRow>
        </Table>

        ### Attending practitioners feel confident in proposing and recording the right cause of death

        <Table>
            <TableHeader>
                <TableCell>Success indicators</TableCell>
                <TableCell>Failure indicators</TableCell>
            </TableHeader>
            <TableRow>
                <TableCell>
                    * User satisfaction – gather survey feedback on satisfaction with the service
                    * Medical Examiner approvals – the proportion of MCCDs that receive ME sign-off on first submission
                </TableCell>
                <TableCell>
                    * Repeated Medical Examiner rejections – the proportion of MCCDs which are repeatedly rejected by scrutiny – these users will be targeted for follow-up feedback
                    * Duplicate MCCDs – the number of cases where multiple MCCDs are created for a single deceased person
                </TableCell>
            </TableRow>
        </Table>

        ### Registrars get the information they need to register the death within 5 days following medical examiner sign off

        <Table>
            <TableHeader>
                <TableCell>Success indicators</TableCell>
                <TableCell>Failure indicators</TableCell>
            </TableHeader>
            <TableRow>
                <TableCell>
                    * Medical examiner sign-off – the proportion of MCCDs that receive medical examiner sign-off within 2 days of the death
                    * Registration in 5 days – the proportion of MCCDs that are registered with a local register office within 5 calendar days of Medical Examiner sign-off
                </TableCell>
                <TableCell>
                    * Registrar rejections – the number of MCCDs rejected by registrars and the reasons for their rejection
                </TableCell>
            </TableRow>
        </Table>
