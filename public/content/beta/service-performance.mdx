            As we prepare for beta, we've been exploring how we could use data to monitor our performance. Our aim is to have a performance framework with measures that will enable us to understand if we're meeting user needs and outcomes, and is effectively supporting users through the death management journey.

        ## Approach
    </GridColumn>
    
    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        As the MCCD is within the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) Death Certification Reform programme, our approach has been to work with the other stakeholders in the death management journey throughout our alpha, to ensure we're taking an holistic approach to the user journey.

        We ran a workshop to map user needs against outcomes, prioritise these, and identify success and failure indicators against the key outcomes identified for the MCCD, which has formed our Performance Framework.

        We shared our outcomes and leading indicators with GRO and ONS to understand their priority outcomes, and are planning a follow-up workshop to look at the wider death management pathway which will include representation from:

        * DHSC Death Certification Reform Policy
        * Office for National Statistics (ONS)
        * General Register Office (GRO)
        * HM Passport Office (HMPO)
        * Welsh Government

        ## Challenging our riskiest assumptions
    </GridColumn>
    
    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        As identified in our [riskiest assumptions](/assumptions/assumption-1), the wider death management journey the MCCD sits within is a highly variable environment, with factors that may impact our outcomes and ability to measure performance against them:

        * death management journey – there are other systems and actors within this wider journey also working to the same policy outcomes
        * variation in local practices – the order and type of activities involved in a successful user journey can vary significantly between locations
        * service transformation – being part of a wider transformation programme, users of the MCCD service will be adjusting to other changes to their processes and ways of working
        * holistic reporting – many outcomes are driven by the impact on the overall journey, reporting against these requires access to data from our stakeholders

        As a result, we have focused our efforts on where the MCCD can make a measurable impact, or where we can contribute to an outcome alongside the other stakeholders in the journey, and identified three priority outcomes.

            ### At anytime and anywhere, the right attending practitioners (or when appropriate, the medical examiner) can easily record the proposed cause of death
