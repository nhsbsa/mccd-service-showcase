        The digital MCCD form and process aims reduce the impact of new legislation on the death certification journey whilst making it easier for staff to certify a death.

        The new digital form will:

        * Improve the quality and accuracy of the medical certificate cause of death. Also allowing for quicker certification of death and reduces costs.
        * Allow the right attending practitioners (or medical examiners) to easily record the proposed cause of death at anytime, from anywhere.
        * Help ensure the attending practitioners feel confident in proposing the cause of death.
        * Help ensure the registers get the information they need to register the death within 5 days following medical examiner sign off.

        Multiple versions of the service have been iterated and explored throughout this Alpha phase and we will continue to iterate and refine the current version of the service throughout the Beta phase.

        The current 'minimum viable' version is one that best meets the priority outcomes for users and for policy within the agreed timeframes. All versions allowed for an attending practitioner to complete an MCCD. However the distinct features of this version allows for.

        * A Longer term, sustainable solution allowing secure access for all users. Without providing temporary solutions that would increase the security risk.
        * Negates the need for manual, off-system authentication of staff completing an MCCD
        * Reduce manual processing and hand-overs where the MCCD moves between roles and organisations.
        * Reduce re-entry of data from day one, helping to reduce overall burden on staff completing or reviewing an MCCD.
        * An ability to amend and change an MCCD, rather than starting another certificate again.

        ### What are we trying to learn in beta?

        Throughout the best phase we aim to continuously refine and iterate the service to help ensure the digital form can best support death certification as a whole. Here are some of the main areas we'll focus on:

        ### Does the new digital form support staff in certifying a death better than the current paper form and process? 

        So far this assumption has been tested through multiple rounds of research and testing and we want to continue to understand if this assumption still holds up in the real world.

        ### Can we better support medical examiner offices and other administrative staff in managing certificates?

        We understand that Medical examiner officers and other administrative staff are key in ensuring everything doesn't grind to a halt. Where we are relying on existing process and systems to support this, we want to monitor this throughout the beta phase with further testing.

        ### How would notifying the bereaved or representative make the start of their registration journey easier?

        The alpha phase has helped us to understand that in most instances there is a conversation around registration. However the level of information and how that information is received varies and a notification may help to provide a clear, consistent communication on what to do next in their journey. Further design and testing is needed throughout the beta phase to better understand what information is needed here and how the information should be communicated.

        ### How well does the service support users when things don't go as planned. e.g. If an attending practitioner is unavailable to make amends?

        Currently a lot of this happens off-system and with the changes to the form and digital journey, there will likely be a reduce number of errors and mistakes within the form. We'll continue to monitor, design and test areas such as rejections, amendments, absences and amendments to better support the death certification journey as a whole.
