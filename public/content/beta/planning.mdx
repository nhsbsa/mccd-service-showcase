            We aim to take a pragmatic approach to beta and ensure we build what we are confident is proven, whilst continuing to investigate and test iteratively. Adding function and features that will help us continue to meet service outcomes and product objectives.

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        The team have been organically working towards Beta by validating and investigating technical options as we’ve progressed sprint by sprint.

        In sprint 5 we got together in person for a beta planning workshop, which rolled on across 3 days. By that point we had managed to MoSCoW features within the service map to understand what features and functionality were ‘must haves’ (based on value – meeting user needs and outcomes Vs effort).

        * Consider continuation of service and how the product fits into the overall rollout timescale
        * Align as closely as possible with policy roll out, and communication
        * Staggered approach to understand impact before wider roll out begins
        * Start roll out to users with the chosen authentication already embedded within their working practices (one less technology to learn)
        * Start with a small number of Attending Practitioners and wider number of Medical Examiners to minimise clinical risk impact

        This a complex project with the two biggest challenges to roll out being:

        * Onboarding (authorisation) and authentication that covers all GMC registered practitioners in England Wales
        * Providing the product in bi-lingual for Welsh Health Care Professionals

        We suggest testing the private beta with a small number of users who already have CIS2 as their auth system, then when we have an MVP for non-CIS2 users – roll out to a % of those users to test (including Welsh for Bi-lingual testing) before a full roll out in public beta.
