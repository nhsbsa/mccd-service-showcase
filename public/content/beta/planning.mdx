    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        The team have been organically working towards Beta by validating and investigating technical options as we’ve progressed sprint by sprint.

        In sprint 5 we got together in person for a beta planning workshop, which rolled on across 3 days. By that point we had managed to MoSCoW features within the service map to understand what features and functionality were ‘must haves’ (based on value – meeting user needs and outcomes Vs effort).

        ## Principles of private beta
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        * Consider continuation of service and how the product fits into the overall rollout timescale
        * Align as closely as possible with policy roll out, and communication
        * Staggered approach to understand impact before wider roll out begins
        * Start roll out to users with the chosen authentication already embedded within their working practices (one less technology to learn)
        * Start with a small number of Attending Practitioners and wider number of Medical Examiners to minimise clinical risk impact

        ![High-level beta plan roadmap](/artefacts/images/beta-plan-estimate.png)
        
        This a complex project with the two biggest challenges to roll out being:

        * Onboarding (authorisation) and authentication that covers all GMC registered practitioners in England Wales
        * Providing the product in bi-lingual for Welsh Health Care Professionals

        We suggest testing the private beta with a small number of users who already have CIS2 as their auth system, then when we have an MVP for non-CIS2 users – roll out to a % of those users to test (including Welsh for Bi-lingual testing) before a full roll out in public beta.
