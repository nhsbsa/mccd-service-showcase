            We needed to understand the context of the problem space we are working in and some of the policy drivers that necessitated death certificate reform.

    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        When a person dies, the attending practitioner prepares a certificate stating the cause of death. This certificate is known as the Medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD). The MCCD must be completed and delivered to the registrar within 5 days for a relative to register the death. Once the death has been registered the relative will be given the death certificate.

        The MCCD is currently a paper form available to attending practitioners in a book. The MCCD is used in England and Wales and there is a bilingual form which is used in Wales.

        * The death certification system in England and Wales is overdue for reform - it has remained largely unchanged for over fifty years. Introducing a robust system in England and Wales whereby all deaths would be subject to either a medical examiner's scrutiny or a coroner's investigation has been an ambition of successive Governments and ministers. 
        * The importance of death certification and the introduction of medical examiners has been underlined in numerous reports and inquiries including the 'Shipman Inquiry third report 2003', 'Report of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust Public Inquiry - Vol 2 - 2013', 'Morecambe Bay Investigation 2015' and 'Learning from Gosport 2018'
        * The relevant primary legislation was commenced on 1 October 2023, specifically sections 19 and 20 of the Coroner and Justice Act 2009 and Section 169 of the Health and Care Act 2022.  The commencement of the relevant primary legislation is the first step towards the statutory system because it will enable regulations to be made. The draft regulations for the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death, Medical Examiners and National Medical Examiner will be published in Autumn 2023.  The full set of reforms will be introduced from April 2024.
        * Death Certification Reform is a cross government programme and includes changes to practices for multiple professions such as medical practitioners, coroners and registrars as well as all those involved in the death management journey.
