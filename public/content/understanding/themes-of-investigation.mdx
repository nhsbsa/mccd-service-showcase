        ## Supporting interactions between MCCD users
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        * Following the last alpha assessment, we focused more on how a digital MCCD could fit into the wider DCR journey.

    <InsetText>
        <Details title={'Research insights'}>  
        In the initial alpha, we spent time focusing on understanding questions within the form. We considered the points of interactions between APS and MEs during an MCCD scrutiny. We needed to explore how these handoffs could happen.
        </Details>
    </InsetText>

        ### This relates to user needs of 'knowing when to act' 

        * As an AP, I need to know when a medical examiner officer or ME want me to make an edit to the MCCD so that I do not cause delays in the MCCD being sent to the registrar. 
        * As an ME, I need to know when an MCCD is ready for scrutiny, so that I can review the MCCD and respond accordingly.  

        ### What we tested 

        We ran two research streams in parallel, to explore this at both macro and micro levels (journey and interface respectively): 

        1. concept testing the initial 'to be' journey (image 1)
        2. concept testing an initial dashboard design (image 2)

    <InsetText>
        <Details title={'Participants in research'}>  
        We involved both APs and MEs in both streams to ensure we could explore handoffs and potential risks in depth.

            </GridColumn>
        </GridRow>

        We found: 

        * our assumption that the MCCD triggered scrutiny was not always correct
        * mental models and reception of the ideas varied – depending on the sophistication of existing processes and systems
        * we need to develop a product that is flexible enough to work irrespective of system sophistication
        * we need to consider the role of medical examiner officers in the process

        <WarningCallout title={"Dual role GP"} className="quote">
            “I can see how this could be useful for hospices (if they could get the certificate ready in this platform, we'd just review it from here and approve)”
        </WarningCallout>

        <WarningCallout title={"AP"} className="quote">
            “We wouldn't start an MCCD before scrutiny is done and CoD is agreed on. The scrutiny outcomes are usually known before creating the MCCD, so we might not see the scrutiny tag”

        <WarningCallout title={"Dual role GP"} className="quote">
            “Making that person write the details could feel like a waste of time - making them summarise the conversation again after the referral”
        </WarningCallout>

    <InsetText>
        <Details title={'Research insights'}>   
        We consistently found that responses varied according to participant's mental models of MCCD completion. For those with little experience of ME scrutiny or where pilot systems were less integrated between MEs and community APs (such as GPs or those working in hospices), our initial design of the completed MCCD triggering scrutiny, and feedback happening within the MCCD, was reasonably well received. In contrast, we found those who worked in areas with more sophisticated integration between MEs and community-based APs found the 'to be' concept disconcerting. For them it seemed to duplicate elements of scrutiny and discussion that would have happened before the MCCD was completed. This underscored the importance of developing a product that works for users with different levels of integration. 
        </Details>
    </InsetText>

        Whilst much of the design could work for various integration scenarios, one challenge we may face is the requirement for MEs to complete a declaration to approve its content (following review of the MCCD). For those who used their own systems to liaise with the AP and agree the cause of death, completing the declaration was a duplication of work for the ME. The ME expected their medical examiner office to be able to confirm that the MCCD matched the agreed proposed cause of death recorded on their systems. This is, however, a legal requirement. 

        We challenged our initial idea of a dashboard, testing both dashboard and non-dashboard designs.  

    <InsetText>
        <Details title={'Research insights'}>  
        After initial testing, we continued to test ways of communicating MCCD transfers between MEs and APs, considering both dashboard and non-dashboard designs. In the dashboard design, the status labels gave users a visual indication of waiting for a response and a response has been received. In contrast, the non-dashboard relied on communicating this solely via email notification, with MCCDs only being visible when the user had something to action.

        Both options seemed viable from usability and concept testing. Although participants tended to report preferring the dashboard design, relying solely on emails might result in missed actions or a degree of distrust.

        <Details title={'Design rationale and insights'}>  
        Initial designs for the digital MCCD followed a one question per page format, in line with good practice. When testing the full question set, most of the form was completed with minimal friction. However, questions relating to the cause of death were the exception.
        </Details>
    </InsetText>

        ### What we found 

        * Separating the cause of death questions, prevent users from easily identifying the correct narrative. 
        * TThis makes completing the MCCD more difficult and slower, and increases the risk of mistakes. 

        <WarningCallout title={"Dual role AP"} className="quote">
            “I think you'll get fewer confusions if it's on one page. Because that's how that paper form is, and it prompts people to think about the order of business.”

        <WarningCallout title={"ME"} className="quote">
            “It would be nice to see these questions played out in one menu because this going back and forth is ok, functional and nice and clear but [its a pain]... I wouldn't have misinterpreted it, if I'd seen the next question later on.”
        </WarningCallout>

     <InsetText>
        <Details title={'Research insights'}>  
        We found one page per question was problematic for the cause of death questions (1a, 1b, 1c and part 2). Separating these questions consistently caused confusion and created friction in the journey for users. They spent time going back and forth between the questions, often amending previously input content.  
        </Details>
    </InsetText>

        We tested several variations and found that including all questions (part 1 and 2) on the same page was the most optimal journey. It allowed users to tell a cohesive narrative building upon each question.

        <WarningCallout title={"Dual role AP"} className="quote">
            “Ah right, so I got confused here, diabetes should be going in here. If you laid it out, so it looks more like the paper one. Maybe if you had this bit more clearly question one and then question 2 on the same page, I think that would probably make more sense than separating them.”

            </GridColumn>
        </GridRow>

        We've recently iterated further, to improve question clarity and data quality by: 

        * adding 'time since onset' onto the same line as the condition it relates to
        * allowing users to specify the unit of measurement
        
        <WarningCallout title={"ME"} className="quote">

    <InsetText>
        <Details title={'Design rationale'}> 
        In feedback, users said that placing the time of onset field under the input field it relates to is confusing. We've now moved the time of onset field to the same row. We've also tested how we might improve data accuracy for ONS by including units of measurement in the time field.  This still requires further testing.

        ## Reducing administrative burden
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        We explored how we might reduce the administrative burden for our users and support those completing an MCCD to submit accurate MCCDs first time.

        ### This relates to user needs of 'speed' and 'accuracy' 

        * As an AP I need to complete the MCCD as quickly as possible so that I can move onto working on my next task.
        * As an AP I need to complete the MCCD accurately first time, so I don't have to waste my time re-doing it causing delays to others.

        ### What we tested

        In our early research we tested the simplest version of a digital form to gain feedback from our users. We prototyped the questions and observed participants completing the entire question set.  

        We found address entry and input of personal (AP) data were both pain points in these early versions.  

    <InsetText>
        <Details title={'Research insights'}>    
        Address entry was required at several points in the journey, including the AP's place of work and the location of death. APs rarely knew their full work address and the manual nature of input frustrated users. Similarly, as certain AP details are required for each MCCD submission (for example, name, GMC number, qualifications etc) having to repeatedly enter this information was frustrating. 
        </Details>
    </InsetText>

        The screen shots below show the four screens that APs would be asked to complete every time they filled out an MCCD.

            </GridColumn>
        </GridRow>

        We tested ways to make data entry quicker and easier. For example, we:

        * added a postcode look-up
        * explored registration/account creation, as a means of collecting basic information
        * included a 'check your answer page within the journey, to enable details changes if needed

    <InsetText>
        <Details title={'Research insights'}>   
        Collecting this information during registration meant that we'd only need to ask the four AP details questions once during registration reducing administrative labour. 
        </Details>

            </GridColumn>
        </GridRow>

        ### In future

        We will:

        * explore allowing partial address look-up plus postcode. 
        * integrate with the Personal Demographics Service (PDS) 

    <InsetText>
        <Details title={'Research insights'}>    
        We found whilst some users know their work postcode, some are more familiar with the first line of the address. In future, we will explore whether allowing either postcode or partial address is feasible and increases usability. 
        </Details>
    </InsetText>

        We've been in contact with the Personal Demographics Service (PDS) team as we plan to explore integrating with PDS via API. This will increase the speed and accuracy of the deceased's information entered.

        ## Reducing MCCD rejections
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        MCCDs queries and rejections are a key pain point across our user groups. It causes rework for professionals involved in the death registration process and delays for those handling the deceased's funeral.  

    <InsetText>
        <Details title={'Research insights'}>    
        There can be a range of reasons for rejections, from queries on handwritten content, missing information, and challenges to the listed cause of death. During this Alpha stage, we considered how we might reduce the occurrence of these rejections.
        </Details>
    </InsetText>

        ### This relates to user needs of 'accuracy' and 'receiving help' 

        * As an AP I need to complete the MCCD accurately first time, so I don't have to waste my time re-doing it causing delays to others.
        * As an AP who does not complete MCCDs very often, I need help to complete the details of an MCCD outside of the cause of death so that silly mistakes such as abbreviations, and missing GMC number, do not cause the registrar to reject the MCCD and delay the informant from registering the death.
        * As an AP with less experience of completing MCCDs, I need help to correctly write then MCCD, so that it does not get rejected and delay the informant from registering the death.

        ### What we explored

        The difficultly reported in interpreting handwritten documentation should be reduced or eliminated by moving from a paper to a digital MCCD.  

        We worked closely with stakeholders such as General Register Office (GRO), Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the Welsh Government to determine the MCCD question protocol. This not only allowed us to remove unnecessary fields (for example, AP qualifications). It also allowed us to identify where fields were mandatory and use logic to help users reduce omissions that would cause an MCCD to be rejected/rework for the AP.

        <GridRow>
            <GridColumn width={'full'}>
                <ZoomImage alt="Spreadsheet documenting the MCCD data dictionary and question protocol" small={'/artefacts/images/question-protocol.png'} medium={'/artefacts/images/question-protocol.png'} />
            </GridColumn>
        </GridRow>

        Knowing that using an unacceptable cause of death (for example,  'old age') is a key reason for registrars to reject, we considered how we could support APs to document a legitimate cause of death on an MCCD, first time. We considered using the Royal College of Pathologists' 'Cause of Death List' to provide a. prepopulated list for APs to choose from. This was something APs themselves has suggested would be helpful.  

        However, the Cause of Death List is only guidance (rather than an exhaustive list), and there were concerns that this could unduly influence an AP's reporting.  

        ### In future

        We will explore other ways of supporting APs to complete MCCDs, including: 

        * spell checkers
        * methods of identifying/flagging abbreviations
        * was to identify input of inappropriate causes of death
