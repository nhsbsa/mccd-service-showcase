        ## Medical certificate of death overview
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        The medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD) of death is a key component of certifying a death. The certificate is a legal medical document, that acts as an official record of a person's death, including the cause of their death. It also captures information that enables the bereaved or representative to make register a death and move on to make the necessary funeral arrangements.

        When someone dies, a medical professional involved in the patients care within the last 28 days of their life will complete an MCCD. This role is known as the attending practitioner.This is then forwarded onto the registrar office to register a death. This then allows the bereaved, or a representative of the deceased patient to register the death and move on with other arrangements. Such as a funeral, disposal of the body or settling a deceased's estate. We've considered the process of certifying a death as a core part of registering a death as a service.

        Over the last 50 years, the paper form and death certification process has largely unchanged. Once the attending practitioner has been identified, they access the certificate a paper booklet of MCCDs for the relevant death. There are different booklets for people who have died under the age of 28 days and over the age of 28 days old. There are also bi-lingual Welsh versions of each. These are currently provided by the local registrar. These books also include guidance on how to complete an MCCD and when to refer deaths to the coroner.

        ### Changes to death certification since 2007

        Since 2007 there have been significant efforts to reform death certification across England and Wales following the tragic Harold Shipman case and others like it. The aim here is to strengthen safeguarding around death certification and increase the quality and accuracy of information recorded about someone's death. Since then, medical examiner officeshave been established across the country to independently 'scrutinise' or review medical certificates cause of death of death written by attending practitioners. Currently not all cases will be scrutinised, however from April 2024 all medical certificates of death will be required by law to be 'scrutised' and signed off by a medical examiner.

        ## Establishing the 'as is'

                We undertook desk research to review existing data from BSA and other government departments, including:

                * Existing MCCD work
                * GRO
                * HMPO
                * DWP (Tell us once service)

                From this synthesis an initial 'as is' user journey map was formed.

                We conducted primary research to check and iterate on the initial 'as is map' including:

                * 8 journey mapping sessions with 26 participants (APs, MEs and MEOs)
                * 6 interviews with Welsh users
                * 10 interviews with informants
                * 3 interviews with registrars

                #### Someone dies
                Someone of any age passes away in hospital or in the community. This can be expected, unexpected and sometimes suspicious. However, in any circumstance, this is an emotional and overwhelming time for the bereaved. For many of them, this be their first experience in being responsible for registering a death. If there is no next of kin, a representative can be appointed to register the death.

            <GridColumn width={'2/3'}>
                #### Inform
                Shortly after someone dies, people involved in the patient's life and professionals recently involved in the care of the patient are told that they have passed. For the bereaved, this may be the first time that they find out their loved one has passed away. Bereavement teams and other professionals are available to support the bereaved and help them with what to do next.

                For medical professionals, they identify and inform an attending practitioner, who will take responsibility for writing a medical certificate of death. For both professionals and the bereaved, this is often when initial conversations on the cause of someone's death takes place.

                #### Check
                Depending on the trust or practice, the attending practitioner will check the proposed cause of death of the patient with a Medical Examiner and other medical professionals. This can be done in a variety of ways, using different processes and different systems.

                #### Scrutiny
                Most hospital settings and some community settings have medical examiner offices that check the accuracy of the medical certificate and the cause of death. They will also record notes of their 'scrutiny' on paper or in another system. Sometimes the medical examiner or medical examiner officer will contact the bereaved or informant to inform them of the cause of death and discuss any questions or concerns they may have.

            <GridColumn width={'2/3'}>
                #### Record
                When confident, the attending practitioner will find an MCCD paper booklet and record the proposed cause of death and other patient information. They will also update patient details on multiple other systems. They may record the cause of death with medical examiners or simply write the certificate on their own.

            <GridColumn width={'2/3'}>
                #### Issue
                The MCCD is issued in a variety of ways. Sometimes the bereaved will come and collect the MCCD from someone in the practice or trust. Sometimes an attending practitioner or administrative staff member will scan and send the MCCD to the local registrar. At this point the bereaved may get some advice and guidance around where and how to register the death. Although this doesn't always happen.

            <GridColumn width={'2/3'}>
                #### Investigate
                Occasionally, where the medical certificate can't be written (e.g. the cause of death is suspicious, or it can't be agreed) then the case will be referred to the coroner for further investigation. They will decide whether an investigation is needed and carry out the investigation. Where an investigation takes place, the MCCD journey stops here.

                #### Register
                This is really where the death certification journey ends and the registration journey begins. With the MCCD being complete, the bereaved schedule and attend an appointment at the local registrar in the local council that the death happened in. They need to bring all the relevant documents to register the death. If there aren't any issues with the documents, including the MCCD, then the local register officer can register the death.

                Following registration, the bereaved can now move on with arranging the funeral, telling the government about the death and settling the deceased estate.

                    We also had sessions with different stakeholder session with other organisations GRO, ONS, DWP and the tell us once service. This help to build a better view of the service as a whole, rather that focusing on the MCCD as a product.
