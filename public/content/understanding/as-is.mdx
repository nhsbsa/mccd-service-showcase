        We undertook desk research to review existing data from BSA and other government departments, including:

        * Existing MCCD work
        * GRO
        * HMPO
        * DWP (Tell us once service)

        From this synthesis as initial 'as is' user journey map was formed.

        We conducted primary research to check and iterate on the initial 'as is map' including:

        * 8 journey mapping sessions with 26 participants (APs, MEs and MEOs)
        * 6 interviews with Welsh users
        * 10 interviews with informants
        * 3 interviews with registrars
