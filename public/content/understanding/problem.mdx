            There are 575,000 deaths per year and at least 87% of those deaths must be certified with a Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCDs).

            The existing death certification arrangements are confusing and provide inadequate safeguards against malpractice and errors. There is currently no mechanism for the NHS to identify trends and gain further insights.

            In April 2024, all MCCDs will be required by law to be independently scrutinised to ensure that malpractice is reduced.

        ## MCCD digital transformation
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        NHSBSA have been commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care to digitise the MCCD process. However, the completion of a Medical certificate of cause of death is only one step within the process of registering a death and we have chosen to approach the problem within the context of Death Certification as a whole.

        The process of completing an MCCD has an impact on medical examiners (MEs) and medical examiner offices (MEOs) given the average ME and MEO will have to scrutinise 8 MCCDs per 4 hour shift. On average between 250 - 370 MCCDs will be scrutinised per year. Following the last round of research we have extended research to include more MEs and also MEOs.

        Previous General Register Office research highlighted that even post-covid, with the removal of informants from the MCCD process, mistakes are still made on the certificates which the registrar must spend time correcting.

        With informants now out of the loop they may be surprised or confused when, at their first appointment with the registrar, they discover a cause of death or language related to the death they don't understand. Our previous research didn't cover the bereaved (informants) and to further understand the impacts on this user group, we have widened our research to ensure we have captured all the main problem spaces with the service 'as is'.

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        We documented a map of problems against each step of the service on a Miro board.
        
        The main issues in recording an MCCD are as follows:

        * mistakes or missing information can lead to delays or re-work
        * details about the deceased person are re-entered multiple times on multiple systems
        * if an attending practitioner can't be identified, or they are unavailable, this can cause significant delays
        * staff can find the form difficult to understand or are not trained to complete an MCCD, leading to mistakes and re-work
        * there is no single authentication system that covers all health practitioners across England and Wales

        Consequently, we have decided that the three key outcomes we need to focus on are:

        1. At anytime and anywhere, the right attending practitioners (or when appropriate, the medical examiner) can easily record the proposed cause of death.
        2. Attending practitioners feel confident in proposing and recording the right cause of death.
        3. Registrars get the information they need to register the death within 5 days following sign off by a medical examiner.

        With these outcomes in mind, the new digitised MCCD service will be designed around users, will streamline the workflow of attending practitioners and medical examiners, enable reporting, vastly improve efficiency, and support the bereaved.

        With all these outcomes, we must consider that policy roll-out is scheduled for April 2024.
