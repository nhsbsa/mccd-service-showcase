        ## Background

        When a person dies, the attending practitioner prepares a certificate stating the cause of death. This certificate is known as the Medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD). The MCCD must be completed and delivered to the registrar within 5 days for a relative to register the death. Once the death has been registered the relative will be given the death certificate.

        The MCCD is currently a paper form available to attending practitioners in a book. The MCCD is used in England and Wales and there is a bilingual form which is used in Wales.

        The existing death certification arrangements are confusing and provide inadequate safeguards against malpractice and errors. There is currently no mechanism for the NHS to identify trends and learn lesson.

        ## MCCD digital transformation

        The NHSBSA has been commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care to digitise MCCDs. There are many advantages and reasons for digitising the form at this stage, many of which are driven by the death certificate reforms which came out of the Shipman Inquiry and the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust Public Inquiry.

        From April 2024, all non-coronial deaths must be independently scrutinised by a medical examiner and the cause of death will have to be agreed between an attending practitioner and medical examiner. A digitised MCCD will allow attending practitioners and medical examiners to access the document from different locations in a more joined up and collaborative service.

        Other reasons for digitising the MCCD form are:

        * new legislation requires the addition of new fields
        * difficulty accessing the MCCD book
        * poor handwriting

        The new digitised MCCD service will be designed around users, it will help streamline the workflow of attending practitioners and medical examiners and enable reporting. It will vastly improve efficiency and support the bereaved.
