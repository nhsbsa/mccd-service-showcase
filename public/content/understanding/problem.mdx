            The existing death certification arrangements are confusing and provide inadequate safeguards against malpractice and errors. There is currently no mechanism for the NHS to identify trends and gain further insights.

        When a person dies, the attending practitioner prepares a certificate stating the cause of death. This certificate is known as the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD). The MCCD must be completed and delivered to the registrar within 5 days for a relative to register the death. Once the death has been registered the relative will be given the death certificate.

        The MCCD is currently a paper form available to attending practitioners in a book. The MCCD is used in England and Wales and there is a bilingual form which is used in Wales.

        We have produced [a map of each step of the service 'as is'](/artefacts/pdf/sd-registering-death-as-is.pdf).
        
        A summary of the main issues within recording an MCCD are:

        ## What have we done about it?
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        From April 2024 all MCCDs, by law, will have to be scrutised before being sent to the registrar. This will go a long way to help resolve some service issues. However, creating a digital journey will vastly improve efficiency and help streamline the workflow of Attending Practitioners and Medical Examiners, in addition to enabling reporting. It will, in the long term, further support the bereaved by reducing mistakes which currently add delays and make funeral arrangements even more distressing.

        The completion of a certificate for Cause of Death is only one step within the service of registering a death and therefore we have chosen to approach the problem within the context of Death Certification as a whole.

        The process of completing an MCCD has an impact on medical examiners (MEs) and medical examiner offices (MEOs) given the average ME and MEO will have to scrutinise 8 MCCDs per 4 hour shift. On average between 250 – 370 MCCDs will be scrutinsed per year. Therefore, following the last round of research we have extended research to include more MEs and also MEOs.

        Furthermore, previous GRO research highlighted that even post-covid, with the removal of informants from the MCCD process, informants may get a surprise or be confused when they have the first appointment and discover a cause of death or see language related to the death they don’t understand. So to further understand the impacts of the process on all people involved, we have widened research to MEOs and the bereaved to capture all the main problem spaces within the service ‘as is’.

        The team have been testing different design solutions to try and help reduce the three agreed key outcomes, and below are some (high level) examples of solutions:

        ### 1. At anytime and anywhere, the right attending practitioners (or when appropriate, the medical examiner) can easily record the proposed cause of death

        * Creating a digital form to sit alongside the paper form is key as research has indicated most users have access to a computer
        * Pivoting to use CIS2 acts as authorisation, authentication and role management to ensure the right people access the form
        * Clear signposting and content design will help steer those that need to complete a still birth certificate in the right direction before they unnecessarily complete an MCCD, which research has shown can cause unnecessary distress for the bereaved

        ### 2. Attending practitioners feel confident in proposing and recording the right cause of death

        * Building in common component validation has shown to help with any questions that are unclear or commonly get completed incorrectly
        * Content design will help guide users through the completion journey
        * We are restricted by law (and WHO guidance) to have a pre-populated list of cause of death, but the guidance will help in the short-term as we continue to look at how this metric can be further met

        ### 3. Registrars get the information they need to register the death within 5 days following medical examiner sign-off

        * Automated notifications will speed up the process by prompting the correct ME offices of completed MCCDs
        * Save and resume will prevent starting a certificate from scratch when clinical need interrupts the completion of the MCCD, which research has shown happens regularly
        * Creating a digital system will open up future opportunity to integrate into registration systems
