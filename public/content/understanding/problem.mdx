            There are 575k deaths per year and at least 87% of those deaths must be certified with a Medical Certificate Cause of Death (MCCDs).

            The existing death certification arrangements are confusing and provide inadequate safeguards against malpractice and errors. There is currently no mechanism for the NHS to identify trends and gain further insights.

            In April 2024, all MCCDs be required by law to be independently scrutinised to ensure the chances of malpractice is reduced.

        When a person dies, the attending practitioner prepares a certificate stating the cause of death. This certificate is known as the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD). The MCCD must be completed and delivered to the registrar within 5 days for a relative to register the death. Once the death has been registered the relative will be given the death certificate.

        The MCCD is currently a paper form available to attending practitioners in a book. The MCCD is used in England and Wales and there is a bilingual form which is used in Wales.

            ### Death and cause of death certification
            * 575,000 number of deaths per year
            * 540,000 in England and 35,000 in Wales
            * 500,000 non-coronial deaths require an MCCD (87%)
            * 44% of deaths take place in hospital, 56% in the community or in a person's home

        ## MCCD digital transformation
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        NHSBSA have been commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care to digitise MCCDS. However, the completion of a certificate for Cause of Death is only one step within the service of registering a death and therefore we have chosen to approach the problem within the context of Death Certification as a whole.

        The process of completing an MCCD has an impact on Medical Examiners and Medical Examiner Offices given the average ME and MEO will have to scrutinise 8 MCCDs per 4 hour shift. Therefore, on average between 250 - 370 MCCDs will be scrutinised per year. Following the last round of research we have extended research to include more MEs and also MEOs.

        Furthermore, previous GRO research highlighted that even post-covid - with the removal of informants from the MCCD process - mistakes are still made on the certificates and increase time-taken for the registrars. But with informants out of the loop they may also get a surprise or be confused when they have the first appointment and discover a cause of death or see language related to the death they don't understand. Our previous research didn't cover the bereaved (informants) and so to further understand the impacts on this user group, we have widened research to ensure we have captured all the main problem spaces with the service 'as is'.

        ## Summary of main problems

        We documented a map of problems against each step of the service on a Miro board (right).
        
        The main issues in recording an MCCD are as follows:

        * Mistakes or missing information can lead to delays or re-work
        * Details about the deceased person are re-entered multiple times on multiple systems
        * If an Attending Practitioner can't be identified, or they are unavailable, this can cause significant delays
        * Staff can find the form difficult to understand or are not trained to complete an MCCD, leading to mistakes and re-work
        * There is no single auth system that covers all health practitioners across England and Wales

        Consequently, we have decided that the three key outcomes we need to focus on are:

        1. At anytime and anywhere, the right attending practitioners (or when appropriate, the medical examiner) can easily record the proposed cause of death
        2. Attending practitioners feel confident in proposing and recording the right cause of death
        3. Registrars get the information they need to register the death within 5 days following medical examiner sign off

        With those in mind, the new digitised MCCD service will be designed around users and help streamline the workflow of Attending Practitioners and Medical Examiners as well as enable reporting. It will vastly improve efficiency and support the bereaved. All this whilst bearing in mind policy roll-out in April 2024.
