        ### Attending practitioner (AP)

                    Hospital-based APs are doctors who are responsible for the deceased's care and assume responsibility for completing the MCCD. They work in both NHS and private settings and range from junior doctors to consultants. APs attend the bereavement office where the MCCD books are held to complete the MCCD. Medical examiner officers (MEOs) or bereavement officers, provide support, particularly for less experienced APs. Completing the MCCD is one of many responsibilities that must be prioritised along with other tasks. APs work under constant pressure, their work is emotionally demanding and they often work long shifts late into the evening. Experienced APs can also work as medical examiners.

            During the research, we discovered common variations to the AP role.
            <Details title={'Different types of AP'}>
                #### Neonatology, specialist or consultant led services  
                The cause of death is often discussed/agreed amongst the clinical care team and a consultant or senior doctor completes the MCCD
                
                #### Hospital-based APs
                APs attend the bereavement office where the MCCD books are held, to complete the MCCD. MEOs/bereavement officers, provide support to all AP, but particularly for less experienced APs.
                
                #### Less experienced MCCD completers
                In some settings, such as medical wards or hospices, the MCCD may be more often completed by junior doctors. Junior doctors receive little training in MCCD completion so seek advice from their senior colleagues and receive support from the MEOs/bereavement office during completion. Experienced doctors working in areas with lower mortality rates may also have less MCCD experience and need support
                
                #### APs in private settings
                May not have access to NHS systems or email credentials
                
                #### General Practitioners (GPs)
                Often work part-time and may undertake some work at home. They are usually notified that an MCCD is needed by their reception team. Staff working patterns/absences and patients often being seen by only one doctor, or in some cases no doctor, can mean that there can be no one to act as AP. For anticipated deaths, practices mitigate potential delays by having another doctor see the patient in-person or remotely. If a patient dies whilst a doctor is away, some will come into their practice where the MCCD book is held, to complete the MCCD so there are no delays.

        ### Medical examiner (ME)

            <TableRow>
                <TableCell width="50%">
                    MEs are usually doctors in more senior roles, with 5 years experience post-qualification. They may simultaneously hold a clinical position as a GP or hospital AP. Their role as an ME is to independently decide the causes of death of those who died in the hospital or the community and compare this to what the AP has proposed. This process is called "scrutinising". This is key in facilitating the completion of accurate MCCDs, improving patient safety and identifying malpractice.

                <TableCell>
                    * access to the patient notes so that I can complete my scrutiny
                    * to write what I believe the cause of death is based on current medical knowledge so that the death certificate can reflect the most accurate account of the patient's passing and the MCCD does not get rejected based on outdated restrictions
                    * to be confident that the MCCD sent to the registrar reflects what was agreed in scrutiny so I know that the right cause of death is being registered
                    * access to communicate with the AP who wrote the MCCD so that I can clarify questions I may have
                    * to be able to access both writing the MCCD and viewing other MCCDs for scrutiny so that I can fulfill both my roles, as ME and an AP
                    * to be able to identify what cases are the highest priority so that I can complete the most urgent first

        ### Medical Examiner Officer (MEO)

                <TableCell width="50%">
                    Usually hospital-based, often within a Bereavement Office. MEOs often notify hospital-based APs that a patient has died and that an MCCD is due. They play a crucial role in supporting hospital-based APs to complete the MCCD, checking for errors, omissions or unacceptable responses, before sending MCCDs to the LRS. They liaise with the bereaved, gathering information, discussing the cause of death with them and letting them know when they can register the death.

                    * to know when an AP has completed an MCCD, so I can check it and send it to the registrars
                    * to be able to view the final MCCD so that I can make certain the COD is what has been agreed, before it is sent to the registrar
                    * to be able to contact the AP so that issues can be resolved and the MCCD completed without delays for bereaved to register the death

                <TableCell width="50%">
                    Registration is conducted by a Registrar in the Local Registration Service (LRS) at a Local Register Office. Registrars receive an MCCD in advance direct from the MEO, or at the time of the death registration appointment directly from the informant. They check the MCCD for any errors, omissions or unacceptable responses which would prevent the death from being registered. If they encounter any issues, they will contact the MEO and return the MCCD to the AP for amendments. Once the MCCD is acceptable, they can work with the informant to register the death.

        ### Informant

            <TableRow>
                <TableCell width="50%">
                    The informant is the individual responsible for registering a death. They are usually a close relative or friend of the deceased. In some cases, individuals may have registered a death before, for others, it is a new experience. Informants may receive advice from health professionals, administrative staff, funeral directors, religious associations and family or friends about what to do. Often when informants are given the MCCD, they will read this before attending the registry office. Whether the death was expected or unexpected, during this period of acute grief, processing the situation and what needs to be organised is all consuming and those in this situation find it hard to take in information. At such times, having physical information is important. When the deceased was of a particular faith or if relations are only available for a defined period, there may be increased urgency to complete registration and the funeral.

                    * I need to be able to register the death in a time frame that allows me to observe any religious requirements or practical constraints, so that I can arrange an acceptable funeral
