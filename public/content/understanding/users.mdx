                    Usually hospital-based, often within a Bereavement Office. MEOs often notify hospital-based APs that a patient has died and that an MCCD is due. They play a crucial role in supporting hospital-based APs to complete the MCCD, checking for errors, omissions or unacceptable responses, before sending MCCDs to the LRS. They liaise with the bereaved, gathering information, discussing the cause of death with them and letting them know when they can register the death.

                    Hospital-based APs are doctors who were responsible for the deceased's care, who assume responsibility for completing the MCCD. They work in both NHS and private settings and range from junior doctors to consultants. APs attend the bereavement office where the MCCD books are held, to complete the MCCD. MEOs/bereavement officers, provide support, particularly for less experienced APs. Completing the MCCD is one of many responsibilities and must be prioritised along with other tasks. These APs work under constant pressure, often on long shifts/during evenings, engaged in emotionally demanding work. Experienced AP can also work as Medical Examiners.

                    GPs act as APs, assuming responsibility for completing the MCCD when a patient in their care dies, if they have seen them in the last 28 days. GPs often work part-time and may undertake some work at home. They are usually notified that an MCCD is needed by their reception team. Staff working patterns/absences and patients often being seen by only one doctor, or in some cases no doctor, can mean that there can be no one to act as AP. Practices try to mitigate potential delays due to staff leave by having another doctor see the patient inperson or remotely.

                    MEs are usually doctors in more senior roles, with 5 years experience post-qualification. They may simultaneously hold a clinical position as a GP or hospital AP. Their role as an ME is to independently decide the causes of death of those who died in the hospital or the community and compare this to what the AP has proposed. This process is called "scrutinising". This is key in facilitating the completion of accurate MCCDs; improving patient safety and identifying malpractice.

                    * access to communicate with the AP who wrote the MCCD so that I can clarify questions I may have.

                    * to be able to identify what cases are the highest priority so that I can complete the most urgent first.

                    Based within a Local Registry Service (LRS). Registrars receive an MCCD in advance direct from the MEO, or at the time of the death registration appointment directly from the informant. They check the MCCD for any errors, omissions or unacceptable responses which would prevent the death from being registered. If they encounter any issues, they will contact the MEO and return the MCCD to the AP for amendments. Once the MCCD is acceptable, they can work with the informant to register the death.

        * Most were registering a parent, though some were registering children or other relations such as aunts or uncles
        * Of those registering a child, one participant was registering a neonate
        * Just over half the deaths occurred in Hospital, four in the person’s home and 1 in a care home
