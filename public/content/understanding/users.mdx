                    Hospital-based APs are doctors who were responsible for the deceased's care, who assume responsibility for completing the MCCD. They work in both NHS and private settings and range from junior doctors to consultants. APs attend the bereavement office where the MCCD books are held, to complete the MCCD. MEOs/bereavement officers, provide support, particularly for less experienced APs. Completing the MCCD is one of many responsibilities and must be prioritised along with other tasks. These APs work under constant pressure, often on long shifts/during evenings, engaged in emotionally demanding work. Experienced AP can also work as Medical Examiners.

                    * to know when I need to know when the MEO/ME needs me to review an MCCD, so that I do not cause delays in the MCCD being sent to the registrar.

            During the research, we discovered common variations to the AP role.
            <Details title={'Different types of AP'}>
                #### Neonatology, specialist or consultant led services​  
                The cause of death is often discussed/agreed amongst the clinical care team and a consultant or senior doctor completes the MCCD
                
                #### Hospital-based APs​
                APs attend the bereavement office where the MCCD books are held, to complete the MCCD. MEOs/bereavement officers, provide support to all AP, but particularly for less experienced APs.
                
                #### Less experienced MCCD completers​
                In some settings, such as medical wards or hospices, the MCCD may be more often completed by junior doctors. Junior doctors receive little training in MCCD completion so seek advice from their senior colleagues and receive support from the MEOs/bereavement office during completion. Experienced doctors working in areas with lower mortality rates may also have less MCCD experience and need support​
                
                #### APs in private settings​
                May not have access to NHS systems or email credentials​
                
                #### General Practitioners (GPs)​
                Often work part-time and may undertake some work at home. They are usually notified that an MCCD is needed by their reception team. Staff working patterns/absences and patients often being seen by only one doctor, or in some cases no doctor, can mean that there can be no one to act as AP. For anticipated deaths, practices mitigate potential delays by having another doctor see the patient in-person or remotely. If a patient dies whilst a doctor is away, some will come into their practice where the MCCD book is held, to complete the MCCD so there are no delays.​

        ### Medical Examiner (ME)

                <TableCell>Role summary</TableCell>

                <TableCell width="50%">
                    MEs are usually doctors in more senior roles, with 5 years experience post-qualification. They may simultaneously hold a clinical position as a GP or hospital AP. Their role as an ME is to independently decide the causes of death of those who died in the hospital or the community and compare this to what the AP has proposed. This process is called "scrutinising". This is key in facilitating the completion of accurate MCCDs; improving patient safety and identifying malpractice.
                </TableCell>
                <TableCell>
                    * access to the patient notes so that I can complete my scrutiny.
                    * to write what I believe the cause of death is based on current medical knowledge so that the death certificate can reflect the most accurate account of the patient's passing and the MCCD does not get rejected based on outdated restrictions.
                    * to be confident that the MCCD sent to the registrar reflects what was agreed in scrutiny so I know that the right cause of death is being registered.
                    * access to communicate with the AP who wrote the MCCD so that I can clarify questions I may have.
                    * to be able to access both writing the MCCD and viewing other MCCDs for scrutiny so that I can fulfill both my roles, as ME and an AP.
                    * to be able to identify what cases are the highest priority so that I can complete the most urgent first.

                    Based within a Local Registry Service (LRS). Registrars receive an MCCD in advance direct from the MEO, or at the time of the death registration appointment directly from the informant. They check the MCCD for any errors, omissions or unacceptable responses which would prevent the death from being registered. If they encounter any issues, they will contact the MEO and return the MCCD to the AP for amendments. Once the MCCD is acceptable, they can work with the informant to register the death.

                    * to be able to query and/or reject MCCDs when there are errors or missing information, preventing death registration.
                    * to be able to contact the AP so that any issues with the MCCD can be resolved and the death can be registered timely.

                <TableCell width="50%">
                    The informant is the individual responsible for registering a death. They are usually a close relative or friend of the deceased. In some cases, individuals may have registered a death before, for others, it is a new experience. Informants may receive advice from health professionals, administrative staff, funeral directors, religious associations and family/friends about what to do. Often when informants are given the MCCD, they will read this before attending the registry office. Whether the death was expected or unexpected, during this period of acute grief, processing the situation and what needs to be organised is all consuming and those in this situation find it hard to take in information. At such times, having physical information is valued. When the deceased was of a particular faith or if relations are only available for a defined period, there may be increased urgency to complete registration and funeral.
