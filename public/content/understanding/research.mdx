        ## Research approach

        ### Recruiting diverse participants

        TBC

        ### Survey panel

        #### @todo: What is it?

        #### Survey panel results

        * In an effort to understand our users more comprehensively, and to involve a diverse range of participants in our research, we developed a panel survey
        * We invited those involved in the MCCD process via multiple channels
        * Currently we have 400 people who have contributed to the survey and have given us permission to invite them to MCCD research
        * The following slides present survey insights so far, based on 400 participants

        #### Participants by user group and AP speciality
