        ### Recruiting diverse participants

        To ensure we had consistent access to the user groups we need to deliver research at pace, we developed the Medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD) research panel survey. This is a database of people actively involved in the MCCD process  willing to receive invitations to our research.

        We use multiple channels to invite prospective research participants, ensuring we use a diverse range of users in our research.

        These channels included:​

        * The Primary Care Bulletin (England and Wales)
        * National Medical Examiner's Office
        * Welsh Government communication
        * Welsh Language Society
        * manually targeting organisations with special interest groups (x11)
        * snowballing via all professional who have participated in our UR (x61)

        We also used a recruitment agency to facilitate our informant research.

        ### Survey panel

        #### Survey panel results

        * To understand our users more comprehensively, and to involve a diverse range of participants in our research, we developed a panel survey
        * We invited those involved in the MCCD process via multiple channels
        * Currently we have 467 people who have contributed to the survey and have given us permission to invite them to MCCD research
        * The following slides present survey insights so far, based on 467 participants

        #### Participants by user group and AP speciality

        * We have a mix of different user groups on the panel, including medical examiner officers, bereavement services, and other supporting roles within the death registration journey
        * Sixty nine percent (324) of the panel, which included GPs, described their primary role as an attending practitioner (AP)
        * 199 APs are also qualified medical examiners (MEs)
        * We have a mix of grades with consultant and GP being most represented
        * APs and MEs work in a variety of clinical specialities with largest representation in elderly medicine, general practice, palliative care, intensive care, oncology, acute medicine and emergency medicine

        #### Participants work location and setting

        * Our panel has geographic representation across England and Wales.
        * We have participants who work in both NHS and private settings, including hospitals, hospices and general practice.

        #### Self-reported experience of MCCD completion

        * We have good variation in terms of frequency of MCCD completion, include those who often fill out MCCDs to those who are infrequent completers.
        * A higher proportion of panel respondents tend to find MCCD completion easier.

        </GridRow>
        
        #### Self-reported access to and confidence with digital services

        * Most respondents reported high digital confidence, though a reasonable number reported moderate confidence and a small number ‘slight'.
        * Given the nature of work and the user group, we'd expect less representation for the lowest category of digital confidence.
        * Our panel demonstrate a wide variety of authentication modes are experienced by staff.
        * Use of personal digital devices for work was also variable. Though smartphone use was most common.

        #### Access needs – by frequency and category

        * 8% (37 out of 467) of the panel were unwilling to answer questions on access needs
        * 4.9% of the panel have disclosed an access need
        * 9% panel preferred not to say
        * most common access needs were:
            * stamina, breathing or fatigue
            * memory
            * mental health
        * just under half of those with access needs described having more than one

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        Using some of the 467 people that contributed to the survey, we have used a variety of methods to **explore** and **test** our problem space, including:

        * journey mapping workshops
        * observations
        * interviews
        * concept testing
        * usability testing

        From these research sessions we were able to gain an understanding of our users and the current paper MCCD workflow and test our riskiest assumptions.

        ## Themes of investigation
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        Building on discovery findings, we focussed on key themes needing exploration:

        * making the questions as intuitive as possible
        * supporting interactions between MCCD users
        * reducing administrative burden
        * reducing MCCD rejections
