        ### Recruiting diverse participants

        To ensure that we have consistent access to the user groups we need, so that we can deliver research at pace, we developed the MCCD research panel survey. This is a database of people who are actively ,involved in the MCCD process who are willing to receive invitations to our research.

        We have used multiple channels to invite prospective participants to ensure that we can research with a diverse range of users.

        These channels have included:​

        * The Primary Care Bulletin (England and Wales)
        * National Medical Examiner's Office
        * Welsh Government communication
        * Welsh Language Society
        * Manually targeting organisations with special interest groups (x11)
        * Snowballing via all professional who have participated in our UR (x61)

        We also used a recruitment agency to facilitated our informant research.

        ### Survey panel

        #### @todo: What is it?

        #### Survey panel results

        * In an effort to understand our users more comprehensively, and to involve a diverse range of participants in our research, we developed a panel survey
        * We invited those involved in the MCCD process via multiple channels
        * Currently we have 400 people who have contributed to the survey and have given us permission to invite them to MCCD research
        * The following slides present survey insights so far, based on 400 participants

        Using some of the 400 people that contributed to the survey, we have run:

        * journey mapping workshops (8 sessions with 26 participants)
        * interviews (29 sessions)
        * usability testing (20 sessions)
        * concept testing (18 sessions)

        From these research sessions we were able to gain an understanding of our users and the current paper MCCD workflow and test our riskiest assumptions.

        In these sessions and future sessions, it is anticipated that between 83-93 participants will be involved in workshops, testing and interviews.
