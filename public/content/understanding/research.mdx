        ### Recruiting diverse participants

        We invited a diverse range of people involved within the MCCD process, to participate in a panel survey.

        Using some of the 400 people that contributed to the survey, we have run:

        * journey mapping workshops (8 sessions with 26 participants)
        * interviews (29 sessions)
        * usability testing (20 sessions)
        * concept testing (18 sessions)

        From these research sessions we were able to gain an understanding of our users and the current paper MCCD workflow and test our riskiest assumptions.

        In these sessions and future sessions, it is anticipated that between 83-93 participants will be involved in workshops, testing and interviews.

        ### Survey panel

        #### @todo: What is it?

        #### Survey panel results

        * In an effort to understand our users more comprehensively, and to involve a diverse range of participants in our research, we developed a panel survey
        * We invited those involved in the MCCD process via multiple channels
        * Currently we have 400 people who have contributed to the survey and have given us permission to invite them to MCCD research
        * The following slides present survey insights so far, based on 400 participants
