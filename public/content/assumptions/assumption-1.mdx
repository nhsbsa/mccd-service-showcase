            We tested the idea that a digital MCCD would improve workflow, from the creation of an MCCD through to the registrar issuing the death certificate.

        We learned from existing research that being able to scan and email documents saved a significant amount of time in certifying a death. A welcomed post-covid change for medical professionals and local registrar staff registering a death. Not 'digital' as we know it, but a small change that reduced time posting documents.

        We also knew that spelling mistakes, missing information and abbreviations on the Medical certificate of death (MCCD) cause significant delays in registering a death and arranging a funeral. These delays compound the distress that a bereaved person or family will feel at the time of a bereavement. Early pilots on the medical examiner role and 'as-is' research showed that discussing or checking the cause of death before the proposed cause of death was entered into the MCCD helped to reduce errors and revisions.

        ### Reduce errors and delays in the process

        People still see legibility of handwriting as a problem in registering a death. Using established design patterns to introduce fields, character and numeric validations in the form will reduce errors and missing information. Improvements to the quality of the information entered into the MCCD will avoid the need to track down attending practitioners to amend or discuss an MCCD, and will reduce delays.

        Design, testing and refinement of these features will continue through the beta phase.

        ### People expect to spend more time on scrutiny

        Currently, there's a lot of time and effort spent moving documents and managing parts of the process. We learned that administration teams, attending practitioners and medical examiner office staff spend a considerable about of time downloading, scanning, writing and sending emails, attaching documents to emails, and making telephone calls to help move the form through its journey. These findings prompted us to design and test different ways to access the form, manage their certificates and notify others.

        We continue to prototype and test the prototype and assumptions to learn the best way to support the MCCD journey.

            “I'm hoping that scanning, emailing will not need to happen - to the registrar”
        </WarningCallout>

        ### Access the form anywhere, anytime

        We've learned that remote access is still important for some users. Not only for those who work from home, but for those who work away from where the certificates are stored or from where the medical examiner's office is located. We'll continue to monitor this throughout the beta.

            “Remote access would be super helpful. Some of the main delays we have just now is tracking jr doctors. If they could access this remotely. at any time and we can talk on the phone. Would be super helpful.”
