        ## What we learned

        We learned from existing research that being able to scan and email documents saved a significant amount of time in certifying a death. A welcomed post-covid change for medical professionals and local registrar staff registering a death. Not ‘digital’ as we know it, but a small change that reduced time posting documents.

        We also knew that spelling mistakes, missing information and abbreviates on the medical certificate of death (MCCD) cause significant delays in registering a death and arranging a funeral. Only adding to the distress that a bereaved person or family will feel at that time. Early pilots on the medical examiner role and or ‘as-is’ research showed that discussing or checking the cause of death before the cause of death helped to reduce errors and rework in certifying a death.

        ## What we can do

        ### Reduce errors and delays in the process

        People still see legibility of handwriting as a problem in registering a death. Using established design patters to introduce fields, character and numeric validations in the form to reduce errors, missing information. Reducing delays in the process and trying to track attending practitioners down to amend or discuss an MCCD. Design, testing and refinement of these features will continue through the beta phase.

        ### People expect to spend more time on scrutiny

        There’s also still a lot of heavy lifting in moving documents and managing parts of the process. We learned that admin teams, attending practitioners and medical examiner office staff spend a considerable about of time downloading, scanning, attaching, emailing and calling to help move the form through journey. This prompted us to design and test different ways to access the form, manage their certificates and notify others. We continue to prototype and test to learn how best we can support this.

        <WarningCallout title={"GP"}>
            “I'm hoping that scanning, emailing will not need to happen. e.g. to the registrar”
        </WarningCallout>

        ### Access the form at anywhere and at anytime

        We’ve learned that remote access is still important for some users. Not only for those who work from home, but for those who work away from where the certificates are stored or from where the medical examiner's office is located. We’ll continue to monitor this throughout the beta.

        <WarningCallout title={"Consultant and ME"}>
            “Remote access would be super helpful. Some of the main delays we have just now is tracking jr doctors. If they could access this remotely. at any time and we can talk on the phone. Would be super helpful.”
        </WarningCallout>

        <WarningCallout title={"P14, ME"}>
            “Having a digital version will speed things up if the doctor does not need to come to the office and sign something.”
