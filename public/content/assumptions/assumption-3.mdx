        Whilst testing new views that would support attending practitioners and

        Support the management of MCCDs
        
        MEO and GP Admin staff play a crucial role
        
        * Start the process of scrutiny
        * Contacts the attending practitioner to complete or amend the MCCD
        * A centre point in managing MCCDs to be scrutinied
        
        Medical examiner officers need access
        
        * some make small changes to the MCCD but this needs testing.
        
        “if the MEO did not exist, concerned that death certificates would not be written, because doctors just do not see the importance of doing this after a patient has died.”
        
        Role of ME:

        Several reported having referral processes integrated in current system
        
        * Variety of systems
        * Referral to ME process is an electronic form (word document)
        
        1. Sharing MCCDs  
        a) GPs and MEs need to be able to share access and responsibility for an MCCD due to their working patterns.  
        b) MEOs need to be able to view MCCDs and their status as they are the "glue" holding the process together.
        2. ME recommending amendments  
        MEs want to be reminded of what they recommended, or in the case where it was a colleague who made the recommendations, they need to know what they were.
