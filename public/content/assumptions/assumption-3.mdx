        A strong theme from the interviews and testing was that the medical examiner officer and other administrative staff play a key role in the death certification process. They have a key role in ensuring a medical certificate of death is started and completed.  

        This challenged our assumption that the certificate only needs to be accessed and used by the Attending Practitioner and Medical Examiner. This changed our approach in a few different areas.

        ### Support Medical Examiner Officers in the management of death certificates. 

        As a multi-disciplinary team, including policy colleagues developing ideas around notifications, statuses and providing a view of all MCCDs. We prioritised the best bits of these to then prototype and test with users. We're learning that this can be a helpful way for Medical Examiner officers to track MCCDs and be made aware of incomplete certificates and absences. We'll continue to design and test multiple approaches to this throughout the beta phase. Further refining and testing notifications, statuses, reminders and complete views of all cases, including the priority ones. This area would benefit from co-designing with a Medical Examiner Officers, who use a variety of systems and process in managing the completion and scrutiny of MCCDs.  

        <WarningCallout title={"ME"} className="quote">
            “If the MEO did not exist, concerned that death certificates would not be written, because doctors just do not see the importance of doing this after a patient has died.”
        </WarningCallout>
        <WarningCallout title={"ME"} className="quote">
            “It's the MEOs who are the glue.”
        </WarningCallout>
        <WarningCallout title={"GP"} className="quote">
            ““I would want admin to know [so they can ask:] Did they do the form? Where is it? Is it the medical examiners work? Where are we up to? Who do we need to know? We've got the family on the phone, they've said, actually, they're of a particular faith and are desperate to get the form.”
        </WarningCallout>

        ### Provide access for Medical Examiner Officers to view and manage MCCDs 

        Only providing access for Attending Practitioners and Medical Examiner officers to the MCCD disregards the needs and role of the Medical Examiner Officer. They should be able to access and view all medical certificates of death and the MCCDs to support with their role in 'scrutinising' and facilitating the completion of the MCCD.  

        We learned through research and testing with Medical examiner officers that they 'check' the accuracy and quality of the information within the MCCD. Whereas the Medical examiners will 'scrutinise' the cause of death of the patient. Through further testing and iteration, we aim to refine our understanding of their role, and what they need to better support this crucial part of the journey. 

        <WarningCallout title={"Bereavement Lead"} className="quote">
            “Probably somewhere in the region of about 60 to 70% of certificates that are written will either have something omitted from them ...and the team usually picks those up immediately, whilst the doctor is there.”
        </WarningCallout>

        ### Facilitate a collaborative approach within and between teams who support the certification of a death. 

        We learned though research that administrative staff also play a role in sharing the MCCD and informing an attending practitioner to complete or amend a form. We also learned through recent research that the process of certifying a death is collaborate within and across teams. There's a shared responsibility to complete forms and lots of communication across teams to help ensure the right information is completed on time by the right individual.  

        We are beginning to prototype and test ways to facilitate notifications and communications, across different teams. Different teams being medical examiner office staff, attending practitioners and practice or trust administration staff. This is particularly important in doctor's abscesses to help reduce delays in the death certification process as a whole.   

        <WarningCallout title={"ME"} className="quote">
            “Because even though someone might have done the MCCD when it comes to amending it the next day they might not be available, but probably someone from the practise is. Just making sure that something doesn't sit in somebody's inbox for two weeks”
