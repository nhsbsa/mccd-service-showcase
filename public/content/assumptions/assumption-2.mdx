            After testing, we discovered that in many trusts and practices scrutiny takes place before an attending practitioner writes a Medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD).

        Together with policy colleagues and other SME's we drafted a high-level to-be journey, drawing out our assumptions of the journey and scope of work. We highlighted potential risks around our assumptions that helped focus which areas to focus in on when testing.  

        Testing this and the prototype throughout the alpha phase we've learned a lot about the process that challenged what we knew from the existing research. We found that since the initial research, a larger number of medical examiner offices have been introduced. Local trusts and practices have developed processes and systems to help them manage the scrutiny of deaths.  

        Some still follow a largely paper-based journey, to check their proposed cause of death. Although a lot of participants shared insights into their collaborative approach in checking and 'scrutinising' the cause of death, supported by existing or new systems. Often the scrutiny happens before a medical certificate of death is written.

        ### There's still a need to amend the medical certificate of death.  

        Our recent usability and concept testing sessions still showed a need to easily amend an MCCD. The introduction of medical examiner offices and conversations between attending practitioners early in the process helped to reduce mistakes made on the medical certificate. Although with time pressures and depending on the practice or trust – this does not always happen. We've tested and continue to refine the form to support amendments between attending practitioners and medical examiner office staff. Reducing the complexity of going off-system to make amends. 

        <WarningCallout title={"GP"} className="quote">
            "Will this process allow for the asynchronous collaboration between the ME/GP?"
        </WarningCallout>

        ### Make it easy for Medical Examiner officers to sign-off the medical certificate of death without adding delays. 

        With the change in legislation, the medical examiner must be the last person to sign-off on the medical certificate of death. This includes when there has been a change. In some areas this already happens with the paper process, however in many areas the certificate is sent directly to the registrar. Staff expressed that this may add another step to their process. We're designing and testing different ways for to create visibility of amendments and outstanding cases to be scrutinised and signed off.  

        <WarningCallout title={"ME"} className="quote">
            "I like the idea as an ME being able to view what is proposed. We sometimes find that what is written on the MCCD after approval is different from what has been agreed."
        </WarningCallout>

        In the future and considering the Medical Examiner System, it will be important to consider how the MCCD form can integrate with existing systems across the NHS such as EMIS, System 1 and Inphase. Also considering the value of the Medical Examiner System and how that can support users who are and are not already supported by Medical Examiner referral systems.
