        ## What we did
        
        Together with policy colleagues and other SME’s we drafted a high-level to-be journey, drawing out our assumptions of the journey and scope of work. We highlighted potential risks around our assumptions that helped focus which areas to focus in on when testing.

        ## What we learned

        Testing this and the prototype throughout the alpha phase we've learned a lot about the process that challenged what we knew from the existing research. We found that since the initial research, a larger number of medical examiner offices have been introduced. Local trusts and practices have developed processes and systems to help them manage the scrutiny of deaths.

        Some still follow a largely paper-based journey, to check their proposed cause of death. Although a lot of participants shared insights into their collaborative approach in checking and ‘scrutinising’ the cause of death, supported by existing or new systems. Often the scrutiny happens before a medical certificate of death is written.

        ## What we can do

        How can the form facilitate a collaborate process, without adding additional steps to the variety of existing processes that will continue to exist?
        
        <WarningCallout title={"Who ???"}>
            “Really at the minute, they are giving us a digital form”
        </WarningCallout>
        
        <WarningCallout title={"GP"}>
            "I would expect the medical examiner would receive my proposed cause of death and an invitation to view my medical records."
        </WarningCallout>

        ### Support the need to amend the medical certificate of death

        Our recent usability and concept testing sessions still showed a need to easily amend an MCCD. The introduction of medical examiner offices and conversations between attending practitioners early in the process helped to reduce mistakes made on the medical certificate. Although with time pressures and depending on the practice or trust – this does not always happen.

        There’s still a need to provide basic functionality to support the management of certificates to be scrutinised or amended. Facilitating a collaborative approach, especially for a lot of community trusts who do not currently have a medical examiner referral process or system.

        <WarningCallout title={"GP"}>
            “Will this process allow for the asynchronous collaboration between the ME/GP?”
        </WarningCallout>

        With the change in legislation, the medical examiner must be the last person to sign-off on the medical certificate of death. This includes when there has been a change. In some areas this already happens with the paper process, however in many areas the certificate is sent directly to the registrar. We’re still designing and testing different ways to support Attending practitioners to know when they need to make a change and to alert others if an attending practitioner is unavailable.

        <WarningCallout title={"Medical Examiner"}>
            “I like the idea as an ME being able to view what is proposed. We sometimes find that what is written on the MCCD after approval is different from what has been agreed.”
        </WarningCallout>

        In the future and considering the Medical Examiner System, it will be important to consider how the MCCD form can integrate with existing systems and the value of introducing a Medical Examiner System.

        <WarningCallout title={"Medical Examiner"}>
            “Unless it links into what we've already got, its going to cause duplication and duplication is never efficient or useful”
        </WarningCallout>
