            After testing, we discovered that in many trusts and practices scrutiny takes place before an attending practitioner writes a Medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD).

        With our policy colleagues and other subject matter experts we drafted a high-level to-be journey, drawing out our assumptions within the journey and scope of work. We highlighted potential risks around our assumptions that helped us focus on the areas that needed testing.

        Throughout the alpha phase we tested our assumptions and the prototype. We learned much about the MCCD process that challenged what we knew from the existing research. Since the initial research, more medical examiner offices have been introduced, and local trusts and practices have developed processes and systems to help them manage the scrutiny of deaths.

        Some trusts and practices still follow a largely paper-based journey to check their proposed cause of death. Many participants shared insights into their collaborative approach in checking and 'scrutinising' the cause of death, supported by existing or new systems.

        In many trusts and practices the scrutiny happens before a Medical certificate of cause of death is written.

        ### There's still a need to amend the Medical certificate of cause of death.

        Our recent usability and concept testing sessions still showed a need to easily amend an MCCD. The introduction of medical examiner offices and conversations between attending practitioners early in the process helped to reduce mistakes made on the medical certificate. With time pressures and depending on the practice or trust – this does not always happen. We've tested and continue to refine the form to support amendments between attending practitioners and medical examiner office staff. We want to reduce the complexity of going off-system to make amends. 

        <WarningCallout title={"GP"} className="quote">
            "Will this process allow for the asynchronous collaboration between the ME/GP?"
        </WarningCallout>

        ### Make it easy for medical examiner officers to sign-off the Medical certificate of cause of death without adding delays. 

        With the change in legislation, the medical examiner must be the last person to sign the MCCD, including when the MCCD has been amended. In some trusts and practices this already happens, however, in many areas the certificate is sent directly to the registrar. We're still designing and testing different ways to support attending practitioners so that they know when they must make a change and to alert others if an attending practitioner is unavailable.

        <WarningCallout title={"ME"} className="quote">
            "I like the idea as an ME being able to view what is proposed. We sometimes find that what is written on the MCCD after approval is different from what has been agreed."
        </WarningCallout>

        For future developments, particularly when considering the Medical Examiner System, it will be necessary to consider how the MCCD form can integrate with existing systems and the value of introducing a Medical Examiner System.

            "Unless it links into what we've already got, its going to cause duplication and duplication is never efficient or useful"
