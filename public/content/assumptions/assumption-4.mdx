            We conducted primary research with those who had acted as informants (people who had registered a death) in the last 3 to 16 months. This allowed us to understand informant experiences related to the MCCD, important interactions during this time and opportunities for improving the process.

        ### In practice, the notice to informant part of the paper form appears to be used infrequently 

        This finding has been consistently identified across our research strands: 

        * During usability we found many APs don't recognise the 'notice to informant' as a part of the process they're involved in.
        * Our registry office research also supports this, as registrars shared that they usually receive MCCDs with the 'notice to informant' element still attached
        * 9/10 of our informant participants had collected an MCCD but none were given the 'notice to informant' separated from the MCCD form

        Our informant research indicates that instructions on how to register a death appear to come from a variety of sources including bereavement offices, nurses, midwives, and funeral directors.

        <WarningCallout title={"Mother, Registering Son, Under 28 days"} className="quote">
            “The midwives explained about the amount of paperwork involved, two midwives brought everything in. They explained about what to do, the registration and the hospital would help with as much or as little of what to do with funeral arrangements as we liked”
        </WarningCallout>

        <WarningCallout title={"Niece, Registering Aunt, Access Needs"} className="quote">
            “They also gave us a booklet with information. We also knew that after having the form we could make funeral arrangements”
        </WarningCallout>

        <WarningCallout title={"Daughter, Registering Father, Hindu"} className="quote">
            “We weren't given any information, no. I assumed we had 2-3 weeks like for birth registration”
        </WarningCallout>

        ### Provision of information is variable and information on what to do is needed for those who haven't registered a death before 

        Our research suggests that, in some cases, informants are provided with written information, such as a booklet on bereavement, whereas other times instructions are verbal. Some informants relied on family and friends with experience or funeral directors to advise them, especially if there was a religious element. All our informants needed to search for the Registry Office details, usually relying on Google to identify where to go. The pressure to get things 'right' and avoid mistakes is intensified when people are under additional time constraints to organise a funeral. For example, for Islam or Jewish deaths, or where family members will only be available for a short amount of time.

        <WarningCallout title={"Father, Registering Son's Death, Jewish"} className="quote">
            “Because of the amount of time we have to deal with this, we didn't have time to make mistakes. A leaflet, explaining where to go to register the death [would have been helpful], because as I said, I wouldn't have known it needed to be in the place my son died, if the nurse hadn't told me”
        </WarningCallout>

        Few of our participants spoke of knowing exactly what to take to their registration appointment, with several noting they were asked for items that they didn't have with them, though all were able to register.

        ### The burden of collecting and transporting the MCCD is still a feature for some informants 

        Before undertaking the informant research, we understood that the MCCD was now largely scanned and sent electronically to the registry office, removing the onus from the informant. This was originally in place as part of the COVID easements and remained in place afterwards, however, 9/10 of our participants were required to collect the MCCD. Recently bereaved people must spend time and effort travelling, sometimes to unfamiliar locations. In some cases, it entailed 'chasing' up the MCCD so that they could arrange an appointment at the registry office.

        <WarningCallout title={"Nephew, Registering Uncle, Islam"} className="quote">
            “Then I went to the GP at 8am to get the piece of paper [MCCD]. The nurse didn't even know the GP was in.  Little things like that are stressful at that time”
        </WarningCallout>

        One informant had the MCCD electronically transferred to the registry office and reflected on how much easier registration had been on this occasion, compared to 20 years go when there was more paperwork to collect. Others suggested electronic transfer and notification as a way of improving their experience 

        <WarningCallout title={"Daughter, Registering Mother, Sikhism"} className="quote">
            “You know how you get a text for appointment reminders? That would have been better than me chasing, and it might be helpful to get a text message from the registrar to say it's been received”
        </WarningCallout>

        ## What we can do
    </GridColumn>
    
    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        Whilst is appears that there are various offline channels for providing information to informants, our research suggests opportunities for improving the experience. This includes: 

        * Identifying the best channels for sharing information on death registration and the responsibilities of the informant 

        Our research suggests that the AP is not necessarily best placed to provide the informant with information on registering. As MEOs contact the bereaved at several points as part of the scrutiny process this is one potential avenue we are considering. From collaborating with the General Registry Office user researchers who are working on Death Certification Reform, we know there may be potential opportunities there. Options will be explored and tested in Private Beta 

        * Considering methods of communication for letting the informant know that the MCCD is available and that they can register the death 

        We heard from informants that written information may be valuable at a time when information is hard to retain. However, we also learnt that electronic communication such as text or email would be an acceptable means of confirming that the MCCD was available, and registration could be booked. We will explore ways of notifying informants in Private Beta,
