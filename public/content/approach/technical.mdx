                            Our open-source repository is not currently public as we are in the process of preparing our source code for open access, hence it remains in a private repository.
                
                            We are working on the necessary steps to transition it to an open repository.  

                            Our current actions include: 

                            * Scanning existing repositories to detect any potential data leaks. 
                            * Implementing GitLeaks as a pre-commit hook to prevent the accidental inclusion of secrets in our commits. 
                            * Anonymizing code contributors for both frontend and backend APIs to maintain privacy. 
                            * Resolving any GitLeaks issues identified in our frontend and backend APIs. 
                            * Upgrade to the latest Java version (JDK 17) to reduce code vulnerability
                            * Addressing and remediating vulnerabilities found within the APIs.

                            Once these measures are successfully implemented, we will conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment of the code in compliance with the BSA Open-Source policy before making the repository available publicly.

                            We've done the following to make sure our service is both highly available and fault-tolerant:
                            
                            * Utilise AWS Cloud Services: We have leveraged AWS's high availability and fault-tolerant infrastructure to ensure that our service is always available to our customers.
                            * Use Multiple AZs: We have deployed our resources across multiple AWS Availability Zones (AZs) within a region. This ensures that if one or more AZs experience downtime, our services will remain available.
                            * Monitor Resources: We use AWS CloudWatch to monitor our resources and detect anomalies before they become major issues. We have set up notifications to alert us of potential issues so that we can act before they impact our services.
                            * Data Backup: We also have backup strategies in place to ensure that data is protected, and we can quickly restore our services in the event of data loss.
                            * Implement Automatic Failover: We have planned to implement AWS services like Amazon Route 53, Amazon RDS, and Amazon Elastic Load Balancer that automatically detect and route traffic to healthy instances in the event of a failure. This reduces the time it takes to recover from an outage and ensures our services remain available.

                            By taking these steps, we have planned to make our service highly available and fault-tolerant, providing our customers with uninterrupted service and ensuring their satisfaction with our service.
