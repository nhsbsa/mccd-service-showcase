            The design process has been seamlessly aligned with user research throughout the project, focussed heavily on the iteration of a highly detailed prototype to test hypotheses and validate design decisions.

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        * We have designed our service in consultation with Policy teams, in line with styles, components and patterns from the GOV.UK Design System.
        * Design decisions were made with our key [users' needs](/understanding/users/#user-needs) in mind and were followed by several rounds of user testing.
        * We have streamlined the creation of new MCCDs by implementing a postcode finder and user profiles, which reduce the need for manual input of data each time a certificate is created. In order to reduce common errors and questions observed in testing, we have also reduced the usage of free text fields, providing contextual guidance on how MCCDs should be completed.
        * We will continue to gather and evaluate feedback from users in order to iterate and improve the service offered. To support this, we have also implemented a feedback gathering flow, displayed after a certificate is created.

        To arrive at the essential prototype output from the design process, extensive design thinking, workshops, ideation and collaboration is conducted continually as part of our agile delivery process.

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        There were 10 major releases of the prototype, each representing significant changes to be researched with participants, along with many smaller incremental design iterations.

        A brief explanation of the versions is provided here to demonstrate the breadth and depth of design iteration achieved during the alpha phase.

        Each major release is available from the prototype landing page.

        ### Version 7
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        #### Overview

        MES and MCCD Crossover, including:

        * Registration flow
        * AP dashboard
        * ME dashboard and MCCD review page

        #### Content design

        An initial content review of version 7 took place. This review looked at ensuring that the GOV.UK Design System components and NHSBSA digital style guide and standards were correctly implemented.

        This initial review also included:

        * the use of words and jargon, such as how we refer to the deceased
        * which abbreviations to use or not use, such as MCCD, MEO, AP
        * the use of plain English
        * grammar and punctuation
        * readability

        Usability research of version 7 of the prototype then revealed further unconsidered issues with the content. Medical examiners found the start page confusing and attending practitioners found the dashboard confusing.

        This highlighted that the content was too generic, and it wasn't considering the needs of the audience.

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        #### Overview

        Iteration for new form fields and dashboard content, including:

        * start page - content design amends
        * ME dashboard - new content, new table - Certificates reviewed by you
        * AP dashboard - new content
        * ME summary page - design and content changes to declaration
        * new fields - Deceased's NHS number and middle name of deceased
        * summary page - Your details removed

        #### Content design

        In version 9 of the prototype the start page was redesigned to address both the needs of the medical examiners and attending practitioners and content has been added to the dashboard.

        With the next round of usability testing soon to be discussed the content will again be amended, and it is anticipated that there will be many more iterations of the content yet to come.
