        To enable us to work as efficiently and effectively as possible, at the outset of the project we:
        
        * spent a day as a team going through the outcomes of the previous alpha assessment report, understanding where the gaps lie and the opportunities for us to explore
        * ensured we had a large, disciplinary team in place with sufficient representation from all discipline areas
        * identified the relationships that would be key to the success of our ways of working and spent time with different departments and organisations fostering this close relationship
        * had agile ways of working in place with ceremonies that would allow us to work both flexibly and collaboratively

        We began this project by ensuring we had all of the roles and skillsets required for delivering the service.

        This includes Product, Delivery, User Research, Interaction Design, Service Design, Content Design, Technical Architecture, Business Analysis, Service Delivery and Content all working collaboratively together. To understand the large and unique user groups and their needs, 4 User Researchers have worked on this project in order to truly understand the problems the service must address.

        As a team we have been working in an agile way with regular ceremonies in place to ensure we're working towards the same goals and ensuring there are multiple and frequent opportunities for communication and collaboration.

        Our ceremonies include:

        * Daily stand up to check in on progress and identify and blockers
        * Fortnightly sprint planning to align on work and priorities for the next 2 weeks
        * Fortnightly backlog refinement to ensure story tickets are in a good place.
        * Fortnightly retrospective to ensure continuous improvement and reflect on the past sprint.
        * Fortnightly sprint review to reflect on work completed and share this with stakeholders.

        These are our 'fixed' agile ceremonies however beyond this we have also held:

        * User Research Playback sessions
        * Design crits and collaborative design sessions
