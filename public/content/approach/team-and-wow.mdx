        The multidisciplinary nature of our team has been pivotal to the success of our ways of working and project approach.

        We began this project by ensuring we had all of the roles and skillsets required for delivering the service.

        This includes Product, Delivery, User Research, Interaction Design, Service Design, Content Design, Technical Architecture, Business Analysis, Service Delivery and Content all working collaboratively together. To understand the large and unique user groups and their needs, 4 User Researchers have worked on this project in order to truly understand the problems the service must address.

        Take a look at our team and their roles below:

        As a team we have been working in an agile way with regular ceremonies in place to ensure we're working towards the same goals and ensuring there are multiple and frequent opportunities for communication and collaboration.

        Our ceremonies include:

        * Daily stand up to check in on progress and identify and blockers
        * Fortnightly sprint planning to align on work and priorities for the next 2 weeks
        * Fortnightly backlog refinement to ensure story tickets are in a good place.
        * Fortnightly retrospective to ensure continuous improvement and reflect on the past sprint.
        * Fortnightly sprint review to reflect on work completed and share this with stakeholders.

        These are our 'fixed' agile ceremonies however beyond this we have also held:

        * User Research Playback sessions
        * Design crits and collaborative design sessions
